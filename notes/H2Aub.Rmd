PRC1 Catalytic Activity Is Central to Polycomb System Function

PRC1 CMP

[quote]
Following OHT treatment, RING1B binding was majorly reduced at sites that normally have high levels of PRC1 and PRC2 ... RING1B levels were unchanged or even increased in OHT-treated PRC1CPM cells at a large number of sites that normally have low to moderate enrichment of PRC1 and PRC2 ... Following loss of PRC1 catalysis, the total number, average size, and intensity of nuclear RING1B foci were only modestly reduced ... while the number of less intense foci was largely unaffected

The genomic loci of repressed PcG targets formed discrete, small (20–140 Kb) domains of tight interaction that corresponded to lo- cations bound by canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1).

First, PRC2 is stably recruited by the actions of JARID2 and MTF2 to a limited number of spatially interacting ‘nucleation sites,’ creating H3K27me3-forming Polycomb foci within the nucleus.

We provide evidence that this poised RNAP configuration is enforced by Polycomb Repressor Complex (PRC)-mediated ubiquitination of H2A, as conditional deletion of Ring1A and Ring1B leads to the sequential loss of ubiquitination of H2A, release of poised RNAP, and subsequent gene de-repression.

Decreased levels of BAP1 lead to enhanced DNA damage (because of decreased nuclear BAP1 activity), reduced apoptosis (because of decreased cytoplasmic BAP1 activity), and increased cellular transformation (because of both decreased nuclear and cytoplasmic activities)

Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition

we found that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched
